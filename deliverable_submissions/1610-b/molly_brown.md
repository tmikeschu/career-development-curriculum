* Reflection of how to be successful in interviews: The main takeaways I gathered from the Q&A session between Jeff and Ingrid were: use common sense, be clear on what you want going in, practice is necessary to performing well, and stepping outside the general interviewer/interviewee power dynamic can be super impressive to employers. Personally speaking, I think my main challenge will lie in preparing for/practicing technical inteviewing skills. To this end I've scheduled a practice session with Ian in early March, which I hope will give me a much better idea of what I need to practice in order to feel more confident going forward. My overall goal is to position myself so that I feel clear on what I want from a job oppurtunity and feel comfortable/confident saying "no" to opportunities that do not fit my needs (and wants). From my experience at my last job, I think that this is in some ways even more important than the interview itself - I don't want to be in a position where I feel desperate and cling to the first oppurtunity I am given or don't do my own due dilligence in vetting the company/position to see if it will be a good fit for me. For me, sucessful interview does not necessairly mean getting an offer, but in doing a good job showcasing my strengths honestly and evaluating whether the position is right for me.
