## Mod 3 Deliverables:

* Link to completed [Flower Exercise](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/files/Career%20Unit%20-%20The%20Flower%20Diagram.pdf): I have to attach a PDF of this, as I filled it out by hand. Here is the PDF of my flower exercise: https://turingschool.slack.com/messages/@megstew/
* Link to Turing Alumni Profile: https://www.turing.io/alumni/amy-kintner
* Job search action plan for M4: I have already applied to a variety of companies and had some degree of success (one technical interview, two chats with hiring managers). I am trying to do three applications a week at this point and will continue with this. I am also working to reach out more to people I've met at job fairs or meet-ups and network with them, though I admit I didn't get much of this done in Mod 3. Moving forward, I will do two cold outreach emails per week and keep up the applications at the pace I'm going now.

* Reflection of how to be successful in interviews: The basics I've gathered so far from my experience: show up on time, but not too early; speak to what you know and don't exaggerate skill sets you aren't ready to back up in a technical interview; be receptive to criticism in technical interview and accept it gladly; ask questions about the company and come prepared with some specifics; be careful about asking questions that have to do with work-life balance, as they're off-putting to some people; know what questions are off-limits and don't ask those/be aware if they're asked of you; DO have an answer to the question of how much you're looking to get for a first salary (I like Jeff's idea of a baseline, an amount that would be totally acceptable, and an amount that makes you excited).
