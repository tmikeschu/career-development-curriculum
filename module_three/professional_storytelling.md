### Opening
Think about a story that you love -- it can be a fictional story, maybe something you remember from your childhood, or an account of a real event. Now turn to the person next to you and give a 2-minute retelling of that story. 

**Takeaways:**

* What key details do you remember from your partner's story?
* How did your partner tell the story? 
* What made the story interesting?

We are all inherent storytellers, and the aim of today's session is to expand on your professional story and turn it into a compelling narrative. 

### Telling Your Story
Our lives are made up of stories -- they are how we make sense of our experiences. Stories define who we are. The same is true with your professional story. Telling the story of your professional transition into software development helps others understand your motives, character, and capacity to reach the goals that you've set for yourself. In short, your story makes others believe in you.

**Disclaimer:** When we say story, this is not something that has been made up or embellished in any way. People can tell when you're not being truthful. Rather, this is about how to make a true account of a career trajectory engaging and inspiring. 

To review, these 3 questions will get you started on your story: 

* Who are you?
* Why are you here? (Consider both your background but also what drives you to be in this field)
* What's next? 

**Discuss:** What other elements make a compelling story?

Consider how to:

* Create trust with the listener
* Create coherence
* Describe causality -- what made you want to make this change? How is it grounded in your character?
* Utilize a story form
* Tell multiple stories -- how can you adapt your story to different situations?
* Practice until it's completely natural

These ideas and more are explored in this [Harvard Business Review article](https://hbr.org/2005/01/whats-your-story)

Now, let's dive into your story and expand on these questions by tying in elements of your Turing experience. 

#### Activity:

Pixar story artist [Emma Coats described the 22 rules](http://storyshots.tumblr.com/post/25032057278/22-storybasics-ive-picked-up-in-my-time-at-pixar) that drive storytelling, including:

	Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; 
	you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.

Think back to the story you told your partner at the beginning of today's session. How can you adapt that same feeling of storytelling into your own story? 

**Write:** Reflect on your experience at Turing thus far and add to your story. Think about how others might root for you as a character and what's at stake for you. Consider:

* Your Flower Exercise: what influence does your background have on your story? What makes you unique?
* Your Strengths: what makes you the "hero" of this story?
	* If you took StrengthsFinder, reflect on how developing your strengths at Turing has influenced your story
* How have you grown at Turing? What obstacles have you overcome? 
* What turning points led you to make this career change?
* What does your third act look like? How does transitioning to this career bring some closure to this narrative arc?

**Pair & Share:** Pair up with someone else and share your story. 

### Resumes 
*(add these slides for May inning)*

#### Resume Learning Competencies

- Reorganize your resume to lead with technical skills and experience
- Analyze what experiences are most useful in demonstrating transferable and applicable skills for an entry level tech role
- Produce a resume with clear and concise language aligned with current tech industry standards

#### Research
Take a look at a few examples before getting started:

 - [Example 1](https://www.turing.io/sites/default/files/resumes/josh_cass.pdf)
 - [Example 2](https://www.turing.io/sites/default/files/resumes/rose_a_kohn.pdf)
 - Don't be afraid to think outside of the box...Check out this [epic resume.](http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/)

#### Layouts
You can choose to set up a traditional resume use a template like this [traditional resume](http://visualcv.com/www/google-docs-resume-templates/), but you may want to personalize the style with a layout. Check out these sites for building a resume:

* [Creddle](http://creddle.io/)
* [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
* [I Need a Resume](http://ineedaresu.me/#/)
* [Standard Resume](https://standardresume.co/)
* [Kick Resume](https://www.kickresume.com/)
* Find even more sites [here](https://www.producthunt.com/e/create-a-beautiful-resume)

#### Content Inclusion
- Add a __Header:__ Name, phone number, email, GitHub, LinkedIn, personal site (These should all be linked text, not the long URL strings)
- Add an __About Me__ section with the 1 - 3 sentence intro created from your story
- Add a __Skills__ section: Highlight your dev/technical skills first. Include any transferable skills in this section as well.
- Add a __Projects__ section. What are you proud of? Show it off!
	* Be sure to include the following four elements for each project on your resume:
		*	__What does your application do?__ What problem does it solve for the end user? Who is it built for?
		*	__In what period of time was it built?__ This helps set folks' expectations appropriately. A product built in two months should look a lot more polished than one built in two weeks.
		*	__What was your role in the project?__ Front end? Testing? Team lead?
		*	__Technologies used__ This might be the most brag-worthy part for you, but since this element is likely the longest of the four, leave it for the end. Go nuts - dive into what API's, frameworks and languages you incorporated.

	* Does each project on your resume link to a GitHub repo? Does the ReadMe for each project include screenshots of the application in action?

	* Think back to your countless experiences in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Would you even _consider_ trying out an application without screenshots to tell you what it looks like? Nope.
- Add an __Experience__ section.

	*	Lead with your position title, then the company name
	*	Use dates
	*	Each bullet should be value-driven rather than task-oriented.
	*	Answer the questions: _What did you accomplish in this position?_ or _What are you most proud of?_ rather than, _What were your boring day-to-day duties?_
- Add an __Education__ section to the bottom of the resume. Remove GPAs and list in reverse chronological order, from the most recent to the least recent.

As you update your resume, check on what updates you need to make to your LinkedIn -- update this profile as often as necessary to ensure it reflects exactly what you want it to portray.

### Cover Letters
Cover letters are a perfect way to tell your story when you're applying for a job. 

#### Layout
Here is a template for how you can lay out a cover letter:

* **1st paragraph:** Your journey into tech and how this connects to why you care about the industry of the company you're contacting
* **2nd paragraph:** Your skills that are applicable to the job post. Also, highlight any additional skills that you think the reader should know about
* **3rd paragraph:** How you’re going to apply your background and skills to make great experiences for the company's users/customers

Check out these examples to see how professional stories can be told through a cover letter:

* [Tommasina Miller Example](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Example%20Cover%20Letter.pdf)
* [Jason Zimdars Example](http://thinkcage.com/svn/)

**Takeaways:**

* What stood out to you about these examples?
* What story are they telling?

**Other Key Points for Cover Letters:**

* Don’t talk about what you’re hoping to get from the company (i.e., mentorship, culture, etc.). The letter should be all about what you’re going to give the company as an employee, not take from their business — mentorship and culture will happen *anyway*, and not mentioning it will make you stand out
* Interested in a specific company? Consider how to use their tools or libraries in your projects at Turing. When writing your cover letter to them, mention those in the 2nd paragraph of the cover letter. You’ll look like a great candidate if you’re already familiar with the company's tools/libraries. You should also consider how to interact with the company's employees through Pull Requests or GitHub issues.

### Turing Portfolio
As you fill out your portfolio, think about how you want to present yourself. 

Here are the must haves:
* Professional photo
* Description -- *how can you tell your story here?*
* 1 project -- in M4, keep in mind that you'll need to include 3 projects

Check out some examples of how others have created their [portfolios](https://www.turing.io/alumni).

### Work Time
Spend the next 15-20 minutes working on your portfolio. How do you want to portray yourself? How can you tell your professional story through your portfolio? 

### Closing
Find another person in the room to introduce yourself in a few sentences using the new story you've been developing. The more you practice telling your story, the better you'll get.
